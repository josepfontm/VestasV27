# VestasV27

Code used to process the data from a Vestas V27 Wind Turbine.
The dataset used corresponds to an experimental test carried out on a fully operational Vestas V27 between 2014 and 2015 in Roskilde, Denmark.
Researchers implemented a set of accelerometers along one of the three blades. In total, 12 monoaxial piezoelectric accelerometers (BK Type 4507B). The nominal sensitivity of accelerometers was selected based on their location and expected vibration.
In addition, the experimental campaign included an electromechanical actuator, which would excite the turbine blade with a plunger. Although, the use of active excitation tends to be favorable in any Structural Health Monitoring. Our study aims to use solely operational excitation from the turbine (passive excitation).

More information regarding the experimental campaign can be found in the [original paper](https://backend.orbit.dtu.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/128004294/32_Tcherniak.pdf)

This is a previous study carried out by the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). The report describes fundamental measurements performed on Vestas V27.
